# C++ Pointer Structure Visualizer
A tool that helps students visualize pointer-based data structures in C++. It parses C++ class definitions using Clang, generates custom traversal and Graphviz visualization code, and outputs easy-to-read graphs of linked structures like lists, trees, and graphs. Designed for clarity, simplicity, and robustness, this tool makes debugging and learning pointer logic more intuitive.

🎯 Features
✅ Automatic class parsing using libclang

🧠 Custom traversal and visualization generation

🔁 Supports cyclic structures and null pointers

🔒 Handles common edge cases safely

🖼️ Outputs Graphviz DOT files, renderable to PNG or SVG

⚙️ Minimal setup – works with most student C++ projects
