#  TRACE 🎯 
# (Tool for Rendering and Analyzing Connected Elements)
# C++ Pointer Structure Visualizer for MAC
A tool that helps students visualize pointer-based data structures in C++. It parses C++ class definitions using Clang, generates custom traversal and Graphviz visualization code, and outputs easy-to-read graphs of linked structures like lists, trees, and graphs. Designed for clarity, simplicity, and robustness, this tool makes debugging and learning pointer logic more intuitive.

# Features 🎯

✅ Automatic class parsing using libclang

🧠 Custom traversal and visualization generation

🔁 Supports cyclic structures and null pointers

🔒 Handles common edge cases safely

🖼️ Outputs Graphviz DOT files, renderable to PNG

⚙️ Minimal setup

# Quick Setup 🚀
1. Run 'pip install libclang' to install the Clang library
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Place the setup.py file in the same repository as the source file you want to visualize.
4. Replace the filename and target class in the setup.py script and run it.
5. Include the newly generated visualize_autogen.cpp file in the source file.
6. Call visualize(rootPointer) directly in the source code.
7. Run dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png to render the DOT file into an image.
